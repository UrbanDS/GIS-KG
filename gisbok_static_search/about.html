        <h1>Welcome to the GIS&T Body of Knowledge!</h1>
        <p>
          This Body of Knowledge documents the domain of geographic information
          science and its associated technologies (GIS&T). By providing this
          content in a new digital format, UCGIS aims to continue supporting the
          GIS&T higher education community and its connections with the
          practitioners.
        </p>
        <p>
          This digital version, first launched in 2016, is built entirely and
          directly from the first GIS&T Body of Knowledge (originally published
          in 2006, and still available as a PDF to download). New and revised
          content - as Topics - will be continually added as we go forward. For
          more information about this project, please see our FAQ section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being a steward of the GIS&T Body of Knowledge is part of the mission
          of UCGIS: to expand and strengthen education and research with and
          about Geographic Information Science at many levels. Many individuals
          and groups have contributed to this effort over the years and we thank
          them for their hard work and dedication. In its new form as a
          peer-reviewed publication, we are particularly grateful that dozens of
          people every year serve as reviewers of draft entries. Thank you.
